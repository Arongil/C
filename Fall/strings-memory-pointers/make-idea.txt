Make files are really smart!

- You can specify dependencies.
- You can make Make Files really sophisticated or simple.
- They are much more general than just compiling c code.

$make

- Requires a Makefile to run.
- Each rule specifies a *product* we want it to build, plus the dependencies and the steps to create it.
- Makefiles usually live in the same directory as your code.

Structure:
```
product: dependencies
    steps to build this product
    ... more rules ...
```

Ex. Let's say we want to have a Makefile to compile the prime checker.
```
primes: primes.c
    clang -std=c11 -Wall primes.c -o primes
```
